This IS SOMe KIND of ThiNG
There are many lines in this file.
This is the new line at number 3.
Some of these lines are really long, like this one, which is over 80 characters, and therefore, will get printed.
On the other hand, this line won't be printed.
The sole purpose of this line is to test whether I am printing the newline character properly. Do these lines alread contain a newline?
